# DotNetMauiJourney

This repository is dedicated to the **continuous learning of .NET MAUI**. The goal of this project is to explore and experiment with different features of .NET MAUI by creating practical examples and simple projects to enhance the understanding and development skills for cross-platform applications.

Currently, the repository contains an example of a **simple calculator** implemented with .NET MAUI, but over time, this repository will be expanded with new apps and features as the learning progresses.

## Apps in the Repository

### 1. **Simple Calculator**
The first application developed is a **simple calculator**, which allows performing basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator is a simple implementation of a graphical interface with .NET MAUI, aimed at understanding how to use UI controls and manage user interactions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **CalculatorApp/**: This folder contains the simple calculator project developed with .NET MAUI.
  - **Pages/**: Contains the app's pages, such as the main page of the calculator.
  - **Resources/**: Resources like icons and images.
  - **Services/**: Auxiliary services, if needed in the future.
